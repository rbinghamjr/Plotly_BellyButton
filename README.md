## Purpose
Scientists for the Improbable Beef company are seeking to find bacteria species within belly buttons that can assist in manufacturing synthetic beef. 
The purpose of this project is to create Plotly visualizations for the sample data to easily identify the volunteer who has the "key ingredients" within their belly button.

## Results
The interactive webpage can be found here:

In this page, there is a dropdown showing pertinent data for each of the test volunteers.
